Sometimes I write things. I'm (slowly) working on writing being a thing that I do for real. In the meantime, you can sign up for my weekly newsletter [here](https://tinyletter.com/lqb2) and my daily writing here via rss feed (actually, this is busted right now, but i'm working on it!). You can also check out the places I write live on the internet below...
