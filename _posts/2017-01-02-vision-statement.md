**Short**
My top-level values are love, justice, and community. My other values are self-determination, equity, and freedom.
 
In the future (2042):
I will be known in my community as a loving, trustworthy, systems thinker. My community will be diverse, interdependent, and creative. The planet will be resilient, flourishing, and have pockets of tranquility amidst areas of high energy and activity.
 
**Extended**
I will be known in my community as a loving, trustworthy, systems thinker. In my work towards justice for the planet and people, the legacy of my work and way of being in my community will show that I am loving, able to be trusted, and think critically and strategically about how to bring about systemic change.
 
My community will be diverse, interdependent, and creative. My community will have many different types of people (race, gender, class, age, location, mental capacities, etc.) who understand and lean into their inextricable connectedness. Our connections to each other and to the broader human and non-human world are one of the sources of our creativity, which we will need to harness to continually be moving towards a better world and more fully human humans.   
 
The planet will be resilient, flourishing, and have pockets of tranquility amidst areas of high energy and activity. Life will be understood as change and ecosystems and biomes will have enough complexity and biodiversity to handle significant shocks. This resilience will continue to allow different types of ecosystems to flourish, and that will mean areas of calm as well as areas of tumult and activity will exist and be necessary to maintain balance.
