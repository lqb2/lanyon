**In July 2016...**

A friend asked me to share some of my tips and tricks on how to be more productive. I realized there was a lot to share so we came up with a pilot coaching package and it's been growing ever since.

**How it works**

Over the course of 4-6 weeks, I: 

* help you identify helpful and hindering habits & patterns in your life,
* share research, theory, and concrete practices to help you identify what needs to change in order for you to achieve your goals (and faster!),
* help you design 2-4 experiments based on theory to help you experience self-driven change.
